# ConditionalLayout Component Tests

## Test Plan

### Functionality Tests

#### âœ… Route Matching Logic
- **Test**: Should render children directly for public routes
- **Expected**: When pathname is `/`, `/auth/signin`, `/auth/signup`, `/why-atlas`, `/why-tokenize`, component should render children without AppLayout wrapper
- **Implementation**: Unit test with mocked `usePathname` hook

- **Test**: Should render AppLayout for protected routes  
- **Expected**: When pathname is `/home`, `/dashboard`, `/settings`, component should wrap children in AppLayout
- **Implementation**: Unit test with mocked `usePathname` hook

#### âœ… Edge Cases
- **Test**: Should handle undefined pathname gracefully
- **Expected**: Should default to `/` and treat as public route
- **Implementation**: Mock `usePathname` to return undefined

- **Test**: Should handle route with trailing slashes
- **Expected**: Routes like `/auth/signin/` should still match correctly
- **Implementation**: Test various pathname formats

### Integration Tests

#### âœ… Context Integration
- **Test**: Should integrate properly with Next.js routing
- **Expected**: Component should respond correctly to actual route changes
- **Implementation**: Integration test with Next.js router mock

#### âœ… Layout Composition
- **Test**: Should maintain proper component hierarchy
- **Expected**: When AppLayout is rendered, it should preserve all children and context
- **Implementation**: Render test checking component tree structure

### Security Tests

#### ðŸ”’ Route Bypass Prevention
- **Test**: Should not allow route bypass through path manipulation
- **Expected**: Paths like `/home-test`, `/why-atlas-malicious` should not match public routes
- **Implementation**: Security-focused unit tests with malicious path inputs

- **Test**: Should handle URL-encoded paths correctly
- **Expected**: Encoded paths should not bypass route matching logic
- **Implementation**: Test with URL-encoded characters

### Performance Tests

#### âš¡ Memoization
- **Test**: Should memoize route matching results
- **Expected**: `useMemo` should prevent unnecessary re-calculations when pathname doesn't change
- **Implementation**: Test render count with same pathname

### Manual Test Cases

#### Browser Testing
1. Navigate to `/` - should render without sidebar
2. Navigate to `/auth/signin` - should render without sidebar  
3. Navigate to `/home` - should render with AppLayout and sidebar
4. Navigate to `/why-atlas` - should render without sidebar
5. Navigate to `/fake-route` - should render with AppLayout (protected by default)

#### Error Boundary Testing
1. Test component behavior when `usePathname` throws error
2. Test component behavior when children components throw errors

## Test Results

### Route Function Tests (Completed)
âœ… All 10 route matching tests passed
âœ… Security bypass prevention verified
âœ… Edge cases handled correctly

### Component Tests (To Implement)
- [ ] React component rendering tests
- [ ] Hook integration tests  
- [ ] Layout composition tests
- [ ] Security bypass tests with component context

## Notes

- Tests verify the fix for startsWith() vulnerability (preventing `/home-test` from matching `/home`)
- Component uses exact route matching with trailing slash support
- All public routes are explicitly defined in shared constants
- Component properly handles edge cases like undefined pathname
